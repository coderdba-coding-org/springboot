==================
REFERENCE
==================
Based on https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/
- To serve JSON output based on a Greeting 'object'

--> This is a bit different from https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/
    In the sense that 
    the former serves a JSON - which is a dump of a Greeting object
    the latter serves just a string output, 
    	See helloWorldClassic01 for the latter
